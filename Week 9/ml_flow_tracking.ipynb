    "# 🚀 Introduction to MLflow Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "This script demonstrates the core capabilities of **MLflow Tracking**. Whenever we train a machine learning model, we want to record the exact conditions under which it was trained and how well it performed. Instead of relying on messy spreadsheets or console prints, MLflow acts as an automated \"lab notebook\" for our machine learning experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 What this script does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sets up a Tracking Server:** Connects to a local SQLite database (`mlflow.db`) to safely store our experiment data instead of losing it when the script finishes.\n",
    "2. **Creates an Experiment:** Groups our work under the folder name `Regression-Experiment`.\n",
    "3. **Starts a \"Run\":** Opens a recording session (`linear_regression_baseline`) to track this specific attempt at training a model.\n",
    "4. **Logs the following to MLflow:**\n",
    "   * **Parameters (`log_param`):** The configuration choices we made (e.g., model type, random state). Think of these as the *inputs* of the experiment.\n",
    "   * **Metrics (`log_metric`):** How well the model performed (e.g., RMSE, R-squared). Think of these as the *results* of the experiment.\n",
    "   * **Artifacts (`log_artifact`):** Output files generated during training, such as the residual scatter plot we create using Matplotlib.\n",
    "   * **The Model (`log_model`):** The actual trained Scikit-learn model, saved so it can be loaded later to make predictions without needing to be retrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Instructions for Students:\n",
    "Read through the comments in the code below to see exactly how these tracking functions are implemented, and then run the script to log your first experiment!"
