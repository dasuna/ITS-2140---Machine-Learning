    "# 🚀 Advanced MLflow: Hyperparameter Tuning, Registry, and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the next step in our MLOps journey! While our previous script showed how to track a single model, real-world machine learning involves testing dozens of combinations and carefully managing the deployment of the best ones. This notebook introduces automated tuning, the **MLflow Model Registry**, and model serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 What this notebook does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** This script uses the Optuna library to automatically test 30 different parameter combinations (like max depth and number of estimators) for a Random Forest model. \n",
    "2. **Nested Tracking Runs:** To keep our MLflow UI tidy, the script uses `nested=True` to group all 30 individual trial runs inside one main \"parent\" experiment run.\n",
    "3. **The Model Registry:** Once the tuning is complete, it takes the best-performing model and officially registers it under the name `housing-price-predictor`. \n",
    "4. **Promoting to \"Champion\":** It assigns the alias \"champion\" to this top model, establishing it as the current best version ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Load the Model for Predictions (Inference):** It demonstrates how to easily load the \"champion\" model back into memory using `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model` to predict house prices on new data.\n",
    "6. **Deploy MLflow Model as a Local Inference Server:** Finally, it shows how to send a JSON data payload to a locally hosted MLflow local inference server to get predictions via HTTP requests (i.e., online inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Instructions for Students:\n",
    "Run the cells sequentially. Pay close attention to the `objective` function to see how MLflow logs metrics for *each* trial, and notice how the Model Registry allows us to pull our top model back out by its \"champion\" name without needing to know its exact file path!"
